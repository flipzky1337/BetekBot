## BetekBot

A python project, which was made of pure boredom by me for my friend group. It solves a problem of having to consistenly use a VPN to check everytime if someone of us is present in guild's voicechannels. 
It automatically messages in special chat if: 
  1. Someone joined voicechannel, and there was no other people present in that voicechannel.
  2. Someone left voicechannel, before someone joined them.

It also has a command to display each member present in each voicechannel.
